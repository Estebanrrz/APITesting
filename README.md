Future Improvements
While the current framework provides a solid foundation for API testing, there are several potential areas for improvement:

Test Data Management: Enhance the framework to handle dynamic test data generation and management, allowing for more diverse and comprehensive test scenarios.
Authentication and Authorization: Expand the framework to support various authentication and authorization mechanisms, enabling testing of secured endpoints.
Performance Testing: Incorporate performance testing capabilities into the framework, allowing for load and stress testing of API endpoints.
API Documentation: Implement automatic generation of API documentation from the test scenarios, ensuring up-to-date and synchronized documentation.
By considering these improvements, the API testing framework can be enhanced to provide more extensive testing capabilities and streamline the overall testing process.
Reporting: Detailed test reports are generated, providing insights into test results and facilitating issue identification and resolution.
